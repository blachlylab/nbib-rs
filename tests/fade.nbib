AB  - High-throughput short-read sequencing relies on fragmented DNA for optimal sampling 
      of input nucleic acid. Several vendors now offer proprietary enzyme cocktails as a 
      cheaper and more streamlined method of fragmentation when compared to acoustic 
      shearing. We have discovered that these enzymes induce the formation of library 
      molecules containing regions of nearby DNA from opposite strands. Sequencing reads 
      derived from these molecules can lead to artifact-derived variant calls appearing at 
      variant allele frequencies <5%. We present Fragmentation Artifact Detection and 
      Elimination (FADE), software to remove these artifacts from mapped reads and 
      mitigate artifact-related effects on downstream analysis. We find that the artifacts 
      principally affect downstream analyses that are sensitive to a 1-3% artifact bias in 
      the sequencing reads, such as targeted resequencing and rare variant discovery.
